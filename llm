Technical Design: Generative AI Application for Business Insights
Overview
This document explains the high-level architecture of a generative AI application designed to generate insights from structured data based on user-submitted business queries. The system leverages natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of an LLM (Azure OpenAI) alongside a scalable backend infrastructure to interact with multiple databases, enabling the generation of actionable insights in a user-friendly manner.

1. Key System Components
1.1 Search Interface (ReactJS)
The search interface, developed in ReactJS, acts as the primary interaction point for end users. It allows users to input queries in natural language and displays results in a comprehensible format, such as tables, charts, or summarized text. Key features include:

Real-time query suggestions.
Error handling for invalid or incomplete queries.
Responsive design for accessibility across devices.
1.2 Prompt Store
This component is critical for managing query interpretation by the LLM. It contains:

Predefined Prompts: Templates guiding the LLM to correctly interpret common query patterns.
Dynamic Prompts: Generated based on user input and context from the metadata store.
Context-Aware Logic: Ensures that prompts align with the user’s role and permissions.
1.3 Application and Metadata Store
This module maintains metadata about:

Business Context: Definitions of key terms and entities.
Database Schema: Information about the underlying databases, such as table structures and relationships.
User Context: Roles, permissions, and query history.
By centralizing this information, the application ensures that user queries are processed efficiently and accurately.

1.4 Python Backend
The Python backend is the heart of the system, performing several critical functions:

Authorization: Validates user roles and ensures queries comply with security policies.
Query Transformation: Converts user-entered natural language queries into SQL-like queries suitable for database execution.
Integration with LLM: Facilitates communication with the LLM for query interpretation.
Output Processing: Formats raw results into user-friendly formats (e.g., JSON, charts).
1.5 LLM (Azure OpenAI)
The Large Language Model, hosted on Azure, powers the system’s ability to interpret and translate natural language queries into actionable insights. Key advantages include:

Scalability: Handles complex queries across multiple domains.
Adaptability: Customizable with prompts and fine-tuned models for specific business needs.
Natural Language Understanding: Ensures that user intent is captured accurately, even in ambiguous queries.
1.6 Query Executor
The query executor bridges the Python backend and the databases. It:

Interprets SQL or database-specific commands generated by the backend.
Ensures compatibility with heterogeneous database systems (e.g., DB1, DB2, DB3).
Executes queries efficiently and retrieves results.
1.7 Result Summarization and Chart Generation
This module processes raw query results into user-friendly outputs, such as:

Summarized insights in plain text.
Visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, or line graphs).
Exportable reports for business stakeholders.
2. Workflow
2.1 User Query Submission
The user enters a query via the ReactJS interface.
The query is sent to the backend for processing.
2.2 Query Interpretation and Execution
The backend fetches a suitable prompt from the prompt store.
The prompt, along with the user query, is sent to the LLM for interpretation.
The LLM generates a structured query, which the backend validates and sends to the query executor.
2.3 Data Retrieval and Processing
The query executor interacts with one or more databases (DB1, DB2, DB3) to fetch relevant data.
The retrieved data is processed and summarized for presentation.
2.4 Result Presentation
Results are visualized or summarized based on user preferences.
The output is displayed on the user interface.
3. Use Cases
3.1 Business Performance Analysis
A sales manager can query: "What were the top 5 performing regions for Q4?" The system retrieves sales data, summarizes it, and displays the results as a bar chart.

3.2 Inventory Management
An operations team member can ask: "Which items are low in stock across all warehouses?" The system provides a detailed report highlighting critical inventory shortages.

3.3 Financial Projections
A finance executive can query: "What are the revenue trends for the last 3 years?" The system generates a line graph summarizing yearly revenues.

4. Technical Considerations
4.1 Scalability
Frontend: ReactJS ensures that the interface is responsive and can handle a growing user base.
Backend: Python’s modular design allows for horizontal scaling of query processing and integration with additional databases.
4.2 Security
User authorization ensures that sensitive data is accessed only by permitted individuals.
Secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS) safeguard data in transit.
4.3 Database Compatibility
The query executor supports multiple database types, making the system versatile across enterprises with diverse data storage solutions.
