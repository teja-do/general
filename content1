This use case illustrates how Generative AI enhances PJM system operations by optimizing grid and market management. Operators interact with an AI assistant to request real-time system updates, analyze market conditions, and receive intelligent recommendations. The AI model processes data from market operations, grid conditions, and policy frameworks to generate insights and automate decision-making. If escalation is needed, the AI coordinates with system control specialists. Backend systems manage authentication, workflow orchestration, and data governance. This AI-driven approach improves efficiency, ensures regulatory compliance, and enhances decision-making, ultimately supporting a more reliable and optimized energy grid for PJM stakeholders.
