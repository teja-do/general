### Potential Questions a Vendor Might Ask When Submitting a Proposal for the RFP

**Lot 1: RapidPro Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Services**

1. **Number of Organizations (Logical Tenants)**: What is the expected number of RapidPro Organizations (logical tenants) required for each UNICEF country office? Will these numbers be fixed or flexible depending on the size and operational scope of each country office?

2. **Cloud Hosting Requirements**: Which specific cloud hosting provider(s) does UNICEF prefer or mandate for hosting the RapidPro instance (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)? If there is flexibility in this, are there any technical or strategic preferences for a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud environment?

3. **Security and Compliance**: Are there particular security or compliance requirements UNICEF must adhere to for cloud hosting, such as data sovereignty laws, industry certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2), or specific regulations like GDPR? Are there internal security policies or procedures that the vendor needs to follow?

4. **Availability and Uptime**: What is the required Service Level Agreement (SLA) for availability and uptime of the RapidPro instance? Should the vendor guarantee a certain percentage of uptime (e.g., 99.9%)? Are there penalties or incentives tied to performance in this area?

5. **Data Storage, Backup, and Recovery**: What are the expectations regarding data storage requirements, backup procedures, and disaster recovery plans? Are there specific recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) that must be met?

6. **Scalability and Performance**: How does UNICEF anticipate growth in usage, and how should the vendor plan for scalability and performance enhancements? Will the vendor be responsible for monitoring and optimizing system performance, and are there any predefined thresholds or key performance indicators (KPIs)?

7. **Integration with Other Systems**: Are there any predefined integrations with existing UNICEF systems or third-party applications (e.g., ERP systems, CRMs, or data analytics tools) that the vendor must facilitate? If so, what protocols or APIs should be used?

8. **Reporting and Monitoring**: How frequently will the vendor be expected to provide reports on system performance, availability, and other key metrics? What format and level of detail is required for these reports, and are there any specific tools UNICEF uses for monitoring and analytics?

**Lot 2: RapidPro Professional Services**

1. **Scope of Professional Services**: Can you provide further clarity on the specific professional services required? For example, does UNICEF need support in developing new communication channels, implementing customizations, creating dashboards, or ongoing system maintenance?

2. **Technical Requirements and Standards**: Are there any specific technical requirements or standards the vendor must adhere to in delivering these services (e.g., preferred programming languages, frameworks, or best practices)? Are there any internal coding standards or architectural guidelines that must be followed?

3. **Expertise and Certification**: What is the expected level of expertise for the team delivering the professional services (e.g., specific certifications, years of experience, seniority levels)? Does UNICEF require any particular industry certifications, such as from cloud service providers or security bodies?

4. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**: How will knowledge transfer and documentation be managed? Are there specific requirements for the documentation format, and should it cater to both technical and non-technical stakeholders? What level of handover and training will be required for UNICEF personnel?

5. **Ecosystem Changes and Updates**: How should the vendor handle updates and changes to the RapidPro ecosystem? Will the vendor be responsible for applying patches and upgrades, or does UNICEF have an internal team that will handle this?

6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: What are the specific requirements for testing and quality assurance during the project? Does UNICEF have defined testing methodologies, or will the vendor need to propose a testing strategy, including user acceptance testing (UAT) and performance testing?

7. **Project Timelines and Milestones**: Can you provide a more detailed breakdown of the expected timelines and milestones for each initiative? Will UNICEF expect the vendor to propose an implementation plan, or is there a predefined schedule in place?

8. **Collaboration and Communication**: What are the communication and collaboration expectations between the vendor and UNICEF personnel? Are there specific tools (e.g., Slack, Teams, Jira) that must be used, and how frequently should project updates be provided?

**General Questions**

1. **Budget Allocation**: What is the allocated budget for each lot, and how is it distributed across various tasks or initiatives? Can the vendor propose a flexible pricing model based on performance or scope adjustments?

2. **Contract Duration and Renewal**: What is the expected duration of the contract for each lot, and are there any provisions for renewal or extension? Will performance evaluations during the contract influence the renewal process?

3. **Vendor Management and Governance**: Are there any specific expectations around vendor governance? For instance, does UNICEF require the vendor to participate in regular steering committees or performance reviews?

4. **Confidentiality and Intellectual Property**: How will intellectual property (IP) rights be handled in this engagement? Will the vendor retain rights to customizations or developments, or will they be transferred to UNICEF? What are the expectations regarding confidentiality and data protection?

5. **Performance Reporting and Service Monitoring**: How frequently will the vendor be required to submit performance reports? Are there key performance indicators (KPIs) or service level metrics that UNICEF expects the vendor to meet consistently?
