Pricing Structure Assumptions:
Volume-Based Pricing: Pricing is based on the volume of messages exchanged and the number of workspaces used, as outlined in the scenario. Discounts will be applied for higher usage volumes or bundling of multiple workspaces.
Tiered Pricing: Different pricing tiers are available based on the size of the organizational unit and their messaging volume (e.g., small, medium, large).
Currency Exchange Stability: All prices are quoted in USD and assume stability in currency exchange rates. Price adjustments due to significant fluctuations may be considered.
Discounts for Extended Contracts: The proposed pricing assumes volume discounts for signing the maximum nine-year term.
No Hidden Fees: All costs (implementation, subscription, maintenance) are included upfront. No additional fees are anticipated unless specifically outlined as optional.
2. Implementation Costs Assumptions:
Fixed Scope: The implementation costs assume that the requirements, as outlined in Annex B, remain consistent throughout the project. Significant changes in scope (e.g., customization requests or new integrations) may require additional costs.
Geographical Scope: The cost assumes remote implementation with no on-site travel required. If in-person visits are necessary, additional travel and accommodation fees may apply.
Resource Allocation: The pricing assumes optimal resource allocation for all phases, including planning, configuration, testing, and training. Additional resource requirements due to delays or scope expansion will incur extra costs.
Third-Party Integrations: The proposal assumes standard integrations with RapidPro-supported messaging channels (SMS, social media). Any custom integrations with third-party software or platforms will be charged separately.
3. Maintenance and Support Costs Assumptions:
SaaS Subscription Covers Maintenance: Routine maintenance, support, and updates are included in the SaaS subscription fees. This includes updates, patches, and minor feature enhancements.
Support Tier: The proposed support model assumes a standard SLA (response times, availability). Enhanced support services (e.g., 24/7, faster response times) may be offered at an additional cost.
Software Updates: Major software upgrades requiring substantial reconfiguration or new functionalities not covered by the original contract will incur additional costs.
Training Costs: The proposal assumes initial training will be sufficient. Any additional training sessions required by new personnel or system updates will be charged at an agreed rate.
4. Long-Term Pricing and Adjustments Assumptions:
Price Stability: Prices are locked in for the first five years of the contract. Any price increase during the optional extensions will follow the agreed-upon maximum price increase percentages.
Renewal Costs: After the initial five-year term, pricing for the renewal period will be based on the agreed extension terms. Optional renewals are subject to market conditions but will not exceed the maximum percentage increases defined in the contract.
Inflationary Adjustments: The pricing assumes stable economic conditions. Inflation-driven cost increases are capped at a predefined rate per year for the contract extensions.
Long-Term Resource Allocation: The project plan assumes a continuous resource allocation across the duration of the contract. Any interruptions (e.g., pauses in implementation) could lead to repricing.
5. Temporary Peaks in Demand Assumptions:
Scalability: The SaaS platform is assumed to handle temporary spikes in messaging volume (e.g., during campaigns or emergencies) without requiring additional hardware or infrastructure costs.
Overage Costs: Temporary messaging spikes beyond the contracted volume will be charged at the agreed overage rate. There will be no downtime during these peaks, assuming the agreed limits aren't exceeded by a significant margin.
Flexible Resource Scaling: The proposal assumes the availability of additional support and resources for unexpected spikes, but these may incur extra fees if outside the normal SLA.
6. Assumptions Regarding Platform Flexibility and User Management:
Role-Based Access: The pricing assumes a limited number of role-based access types (e.g., admin, user) across the system. Introducing new roles or permission schemes may require additional configuration costs.
Multi-Workspace Management: The platform will allow management of multiple workspaces within a single user login, as described, with no additional charges for managing these workspaces independently.
API Usage: It is assumed that the system’s standard API functionalities will meet UNICEF's needs. Extensive customizations to the API may require additional costs.
7. Generic Contractual and Technical Assumptions:
Contractual Commitments: The proposal assumes a clear and stable contractual commitment from both parties, with defined deliverables and payment structures tied to milestones.
Data Security and Privacy: The pricing assumes that standard data security and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR) are sufficient. Custom or enhanced security features may incur extra costs.
Ownership of Data: UNICEF retains ownership of all data, and no additional charges apply for data exports. Significant efforts for migration or manual extraction will require additional fees.
Platform Uptime: The SaaS pricing assumes 99.9% uptime as a part of the standard agreement. Any enhanced uptime requirements (e.g., 100% during peak periods) may need additional infrastructure investment.

8. Resource Allocation Assumptions:
Dedicated vs. Shared Resources: The proposal assumes that most technical resources (e.g., developers, system administrators) will be shared across multiple projects or clients. Dedicated resources (if required by UNICEF) will incur additional costs and must be negotiated separately.
Key Personnel Availability: The proposal assumes that key personnel (e.g., project manager, lead architect) will be available throughout the project lifecycle, as per the agreed timelines. Delays or unavailability due to changes in UNICEF’s schedule or new project priorities may require additional resource reallocation fees.
Optimal Team Size: The resource allocation plan assumes an optimal team size based on the project scope. If project scope or workload increases, additional resources may need to be allocated, potentially incurring extra costs.
Subcontracting or External Consultants: The proposal assumes that any specialized resources (e.g., for unique integrations or advanced analytics) will be available in-house. If external subcontractors or consultants are required, additional costs may apply, subject to prior approval by UNICEF.
Resource Transition Plan: The pricing assumes that resource transition between different project phases (e.g., from development to post-go-live support) will occur smoothly and within the planned timeframes. Unplanned transitions or onboarding of additional resources could result in extra charges.
Resource Onboarding: It is assumed that minimal onboarding time will be required for resources involved in the project. Extensive training for newly onboarded resources or frequent handovers may lead to additional costs.
9. Resource Reuse and Knowledge Transfer Assumptions:
Reusability of Existing Components: The proposal assumes that certain software components, configurations, or processes from previous UNICEF or RapidPro implementations can be reused to streamline the implementation. If custom development is required due to lack of reusable assets, additional development costs may apply.
Leverage of Pre-Built Integrations: The SaaS solution assumes the use of pre-built integrations for standard messaging channels (e.g., SMS, WhatsApp, social media). Custom integrations or reuse of integrations from other projects may require further customization, incurring additional costs.
Resource Skill Reuse: The pricing assumes that team members already possess relevant experience with similar UNICEF projects or SaaS implementations. If extensive skill development, training, or cross-training is needed for the team, additional costs may arise.
Existing Documentation and Knowledge: The proposal assumes that existing documentation (e.g., training materials, system guides) from prior UNICEF projects can be reused with minor adjustments. Development of new documentation or training materials specific to the project will incur additional fees.
Knowledge Transfer: The proposal assumes that the knowledge transfer to UNICEF’s internal teams will occur during regular project hours through planned sessions. If significant additional training, extended handover periods, or repeated knowledge transfer sessions are needed due to staff turnover or new hires, additional costs may apply.
Post-Go-Live Support Reuse: It is assumed that post-go-live support will leverage reusable support processes and templates from prior projects. Custom support mechanisms or extensive one-on-one support will incur extra fees.
Testing and Quality Assurance Reuse: The pricing assumes reuse of standardized testing scripts, automated testing tools, and processes from previous RapidPro implementations. Custom test plans, especially for unique UNICEF use cases, may lead to additional costs.
