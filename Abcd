As your direct reportee, I wanted to bring a concern to your notice, regarding my new project allocation.

I ended up reaching out to you, given the folks who're handling UAA account haven't responded to my persistent requests showing my disinterest getting reassigned to UAA again (after giving my 1 year already to this acc.)

Originally, I was requested to take up a temporary role in UAA/Opto last year as a stop-gap arrangement (though it wasn't a right fit for me and I had to take a downgrade on my

role as well), the replacement never came.

Because of this, I ended up working for more than 1 year under UAA/Opto acc., through a stressful odd shift (UAA shifts are 2:00 pm to 11:30 pm on paper, in reality they can extend till 12:30 am or even 2:30 am during peak delivery due to the nature of work).

I believe you're already aware of how this has badly affected my overall health and I'm still trying to recover from it.

Given that I have already played my part in UAA/Opto, how is it fair forcing me to do it all over again without a choice to optout.

My previous assignment with UAA/Opto completed on 13th Aug 2024, and I gave a few interviews during my transition period and was invited to join a better role/opportunity in Ucicef acc which I feel is a good fit and most importantly my work hours would be in normal shift (I was looking forward to take up this role).

But the acc has changed their decision in the last minute to pull me back from pool and reallocate me to Opto, ignoring my concerns.

Would you be kind enough to look into this matter. I'd really like to move out from this acc and explore my options.
