Subject: Request for Reconsideration of Project Allocation

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring a concern to your attention regarding my recent project allocation.

I’ve reached out to the team handling the UAA account multiple times to express my reluctance in being reassigned there after already dedicating over a year to that account. Unfortunately, I have not received any response.

Last year, I was asked to temporarily join the UAA/Opto account as a stop-gap arrangement, even though it was not an ideal fit for my skills and required me to take a downgrade in my role. The temporary arrangement extended far longer than anticipated, resulting in over a year on the account. The demanding nature of the work, especially the extended hours, has significantly impacted my health, and I am still in the process of recovering.

Given that I have already contributed significantly to the UAA/Opto account, I feel it would be unfair to be reassigned there without the opportunity to explore other options.

My previous assignment with UAA/Opto concluded on August 13th, 2024, and during my transition period, I interviewed for and was offered a position with the Ucicef account, which aligns better with my skills and offers a standard work schedule—something I was eagerly looking forward to. However, I was recently informed that the decision has been reversed, and I am being reassigned to Opto, despite my earlier concerns.

I kindly request your assistance in reconsidering this allocation. I am eager to move forward in a role that better aligns with my career goals and personal well-being.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
